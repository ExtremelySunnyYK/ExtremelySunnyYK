Hi, I'm [Yong Kang](https://extremelysunnyyk.github.io/), a passionate software engineer from Singapore. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build. I am passionate about the intesection of Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering and Recommender Systems.

I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. I learned a lot from the open-source community and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.
